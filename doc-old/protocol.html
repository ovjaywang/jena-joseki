<h1>Joseki: RDF WebAPI</h1>

<p>
The idea behind the RDF WebAPI is that there are simple, generall available, operations for
working with remote RDF databases, particularly publishing RDF data.
</p>

<p>
Publishing RDF means making it available to other applications and other
people, whoever and wherever that might be.  The publisher does not usually know
who the consumers of the information will be.  A publisher of RDF is not
building a designed, distributed application, but, like the current web,
is putting information up for others to use as they see fit.
</p>

<p>
Publishing is based on query.  RDF databases (that is, sets of statements) can range
from small (a vCard - 10's of statements) to large (an 
interface to a large SQL database - possibly millions of statements). For large 
RDF models, it is not practical or desirable to transfer the whole model just to 
read some small amount of data out of it so query is the basis for access.</p>

<p>
&quot;Simple&quot; is important because we want the protocol to be generally available
so being simple enough for a wide range of implementations is important.
While it may not be ideal in every situation, it is hoped this protocol is sufficient 
useful for wide-scale deployment. Indeed, &quot;protocol&quot; is rather grand - it is a 
convention for using HTTP, XMLP, or other base protocol. The Joseki core engine 
is independent of HTTP although the only binding currently provided is to HTTP, 
using GET for query.</p>

<h2>Style</h2>

<p>
The protocol tries to adhere to web practice
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">W3C Web Architecture
Document</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Models have URLs</li>
  <li>Models are accessible over HTTP to that URL</li>
  <li>Reading information is achieved by 
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/get7">HTTP GET</a></li>
  <li>Operations are graph-centric: they exchange subgraphs of the target
model.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview of the RDF WebAPI</h2>
<p>The RDF WebAPI is a set of operations which treat RDF models as first-class 
web resources.&nbsp;The most important implication of this is that models have URIs 
as they are significant web resources.</p>
<p>The basic operations on a model are to retrieve (query) information and to update or 
add information.&nbsp; Such abstract operations need to be realised by XMLP, HTTP or 
some other protocol and this choice can as much a factor of the environment as 
the technical merits of each protocol.&nbsp; Joseki realises the protocol for HTTP.</p>
<p>The operations supported are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>GET (a simple query that retruns the whole model).</li>
  <li>Query, for various query languages</li>
  <li>Update operations<ul>
    <li>Add</li>
    <li>Remove</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ping</li>
</ol>
<p>New operations can be added - all operations are handled by modules loaded 
through description in the Joseki configuration file.&nbsp; The operations above 
form the core set in the distribution which have standard descriptions in the
<code>joseki-defs.n3</code> file.</p>

<h2>Query: HTTP GET</h2>
<p>The simplest operation is plain <code>GET</code>: reading a whole database
in the way any web server responds to <code>GET</code>, returning the
whole model.  More selective queries are given using the HTTP query string:
</p>
<p>A fetch request:</p>
<pre class="box">GET /model?lang=fetch&r=http://example.org/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org</pre>
<p>which will return the RDF statements associated with the named resources. See
<a href="RDF_data_objects.html">RDF Data Objects</a> for further details for 
&quot;fetch&quot;.</p>
<p>An RDQL request:</p>
<pre class="box">GET /model?lang=RDQL& \
       query=SELECT%20*%20WHERE%20(%3fx%20%3fy%20%3fz) HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
</pre>
<p>
which performs a query specified in RDQL &#8211; a single subgraph is
returned. The query string is the encoded form of 
"<code>SELECT * WHERE (?x ?y ?z)</code>".<p>
The significant parameter is &quot;lang&quot;, which names the query language.&nbsp; This 
can be the URI for the language or a short name - the examples here use the 
short name as the URLs produced are shorter.&nbsp; Other parameters depend on 
the query language.<h2>Query: HTTP POST</h2>
<p>Occasionally, GET isn't what an application wants. Maybe the query is in 
dnager of exceeding the practical limits on URL length for GET; maybe the application uses many operations and 
does not to switch to a different style; may be the application wishes to 
guarantee the operation goers back to the original source.</p>


<p>Queries can be sent over HTTP POST (assuming the server has been set up to 
accept such queries). For example:</p>

<pre class="box">POST /myModel?query HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Content-Type: application/rdf+xml; charset=utf-8
Accept-Charset: utf-8
Accept: application/rdf+xml
...

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;

&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'
  xmlns:rdfs='http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#'
  xmlns:joseki='http://joseki.org/2003/07/configuration#'&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description&gt;
    &lt;joseki:requestQueryLanguage&gt;RDQL&lt;/joseki:requestQueryLanguage&gt;
    &lt;<code>joseki:queryScript&gt;
         SELECT *
         WHERE (?x ?y ?z)
    </code>&lt;<code>/joseki:queryScript&gt;
</code>  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</pre>
<p>and the body of the POST contains exactly one RDF model.  There is a required
property, <code>joseki:requestQueryLanguage</code>, which has a string
value for the language name, and the rest of the model contains the query.
If the query is sent as a (big) string, then the property
<code>joseki:queryScript</code> may be used; the query may also be
structured in the RDF model - it depends on the query language.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<h2>Other Operations</h2>

<p>The general form:</p>
<pre class="box">Target URL, operation, graph => graph
</pre>
<p>which becomes:</p>
<pre class="box">POST /myModel?op=operation HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Content-type: application/rdf+xml

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'
  xmlns:rdfs='http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#'&gt;
. . .
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>

<p>And the reply is of the form of a single RDF graph.&nbsp; The HTTP reposnse 
code indictaes the success, or failure, of the operation.</p>

<pre class="box">HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 16 Jan 2003 15:53:25 GMT
Server: Jetty/4.2.5 (Windows XP 5.1 x86)
Content-Type: application/rdf+xml; charset=utf-8
Connection: close

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF
   xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'
   xmlns:ex='http://example.com/'&gt;
&lt;rdf:Description rdf:about='http://example.com/something'&gt;
 . . .
&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Add and Remove</h3>
<p>Implementations of "add" and "remove" are supplied.
These take a graph as argument and add or remove it from the
target model. The junit test suite adds its own &quot;clear model&quot; operation.</p>

Joseki3
=======

+ Documentation
  HTTP parameters
   webapps/WEB_INF/web.xml needs to be chnaged for a service

+ Refactor SPARQL.java to pick out the stages so the general process can be inherited.

+ Chunk encoding (Jetty default) seems to confuse FF (KERS's at least) so maybe turn off 
  Or upgrade Jetty?

+ Config of one model should be the same as a datset of one default graph
  
+ Locking can't always be MRSW (inference caches) -- Concurrent request problem

+ error testing
  No joseki:ImplSPARQL leads to silent error
  
+ web.xml - change to explicit services and/or    http://localhost/sparql/ ...

+ Add a configurable output processor - default XML results / 
  Have SELECT only processor

+ Update all XSD and WSDL to latest and rebuild

+ Need "application/sparql-query"

+ Teach HttpUtils about "+" as in "application/sparql-results+xml"

+ MIME type "text/rdf+n3"

+ Enable arbitrary classes to implement a DaatsetDesc or be a factory for Models.

+ Get baseURI from Document to set parsing one.

+ Release time?

+ Protocol tests
  Other tests

+ Add version id (build, ARQ) to HTTP headers

+ Add strict mode (i.e it's SPARQL and SPARQL only) q service
  As separate processors.

+ Test harness

+ Documentation

+ Merge in SOAP code and lib2/ into a single codebase

+ Better error and warning handling when dynamically building a dataset

+ Test configuration (test of errors by looking in registry, and configuration members)

+ Dataset cache coupled to descriptions.
  need dataset set cache and "description key"

+ Check whether loading broken RDF causes a memory leak
  
+ Transactional locking in QueryCom

- - - - - - - - - - - -

+ Option for server side XSLT
  Firefox refuses to execute from a different server?

+ "Accept: */*" matches text/* and gets readable form.
  Should be application/rdf+xml.
  maybe test for application/rdf+xml, application/xml first?

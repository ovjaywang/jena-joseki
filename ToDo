**** New codebase

+ Test configuration (test of errors by looking in registry, and configuration members)

+ Search and remove references to "dispatcher"

- - - - - - - - - - - -

+ SPARQLer in CVS as supplied app
  Need ant support

+ XSLT update to latest

+ Option for server side XSLT
  Firefox refuses to execute from a different server?

+ Use ModelSpecs

+ "Accept: */*" matches text/* and gets readable form.
  Should be application/rdf+xml.
  maybe test for application/rdf+xml, application/xml first?

+ Testing 
  Include Tomcat in JUnit test cycle?  Or too heavy?

+ Latest protocol
    Add private params "ctype" (force MIME type of return), and XSLT "stylesheet"

+ Allow fetch handlers (renamed) for DESCRIBE

+ Management
  At least keep some statistics (and provide a web page?!)
    Server, per processor, per query processor
    Part of "standard" processor interface to ensure compliance
  May be JMX (later), 
  javax.management in 1.5.0 MBean
  
+ SOAP connector (Axis)

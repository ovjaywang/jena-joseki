Joseki3
=======

+ Rethink "joseki.serverDebug"

+ MIME type negotiation
  Need SPARQL processor to get Resposen to decide earlier.
  Currently, gets null and is always application/rdf+xml
  Design bug: choosing MIME type skips application/xml
  Need "choose(pref=...)"
  And Response need to freeze choosing.

+ Adding in "uri=" into protocol for SPARQL

+ Request and RequestImpl merge to a single class
  Or split Reponse into interface and implementation
  Drive by SOAP-ization

+ Query only version?  No operations.

+ Attach named collections (awaiting DAWG design first)
  attachedModel [ :graphName   ,  :resource <file:> ]
  or attachedModel <foo>
  <foo> a :namedCollection ;

+ Allow fetch handlers (renamed) for DESCRIBE

+ SOAP connector (Axis)

+ Charset handling and MIME-type with "q="

+ Errors with long messages as well as short.
  inc stack traces.

+ Enable FROM loading in SPARQL processor
  Make server config controlled
  SPARQL *service* processor 

+ Restructure the main server implementation
  ??
    .server.config
    .server.dispatch.
    .server.processor (all process bits - interfaces and abstract classes)
    .server.operations
    .server.query
    .server
        SourceModel
	SourceController
	Processor
	RDFServer
	JosekiServerException
	ExecutionException
	ExecutionError
	Registry (the central one)

+ Better error and warning hanlding when dynamically building a dataset

+ Test configuration (test of errors by looking in registry, and configuration members)

+ Dataset cache coupled to descriptions.
  need dataset set cache and "description key"

+ Check whether loading broken RDF causes a memory leak
  (need loading controls)
  Add a graph that limits the nuber of triples added/bulkupdated.

+ Option for server side XSLT
  Firefox refuses to execute from a different server?

+ "Accept: */*" matches text/* and gets readable form.
  Should be application/rdf+xml.
  maybe test for application/rdf+xml, application/xml first?

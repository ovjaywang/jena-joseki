Joseki2 : Changes
=================

2.2 from 2.1
------------

+ Moved to latest common logging (1.0.3) and log4j (1.2.8)



2.1 from 2.0
------------

Configuration files for Joseki 2.0 work with Joseki 2.1.  There is no
change of namespace nor of vocabulary.


Logging::

Logging now uses Jakarta commons logging.  This can be used with Java 1.4
logging or Log4J.  The standalone server uses Java 1.4 logging even if
Log4J is available (which it will be as it is part of Jena) by default.
Set the system property "org.apache.commons.logging.Log" to either
"org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger" or
"org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4JLogger" to choose your logging system.

See http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging.html

Two new (small) jars 
    lib/commons-logging-api.jar
    lib/commons-logging.jar*

Robustness:

Results with illegal URIs now cause an HTTP error code, not send a partial
model.  Cost (in CPU) is the result shave to be checked before really
written to the result stream.  This si done by writing the result model
twice, first to a null output stream.


Debugging::

Server debug mode

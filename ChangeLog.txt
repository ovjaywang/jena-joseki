Joseki3
=======

Joseki3 is not compatible with Joseki2.


== Joseki 3.0 preview 1

+ Earlier CVS versions had a config file and a definitions file.  But the
  definitions are much shorter than for Joseki2 so the value of separating
  them out is lost.
    joseki-defs.ttl is deprecated.
    Example config files have defintions inline.

+ Supports the SPARQL protocol over HTTP (Last Call version)
+ Supports the SPARQL query language (Last Call version)

+ HTTP protocol - done
+ SOAP protocol - done but highly experimental.
